Supported by $300 million from the National Institute of Health, 21 research institutions across the United States are taking high resolution structural and functional brain images of over 10,000 children ages 9-10 biennially as they progress into adulthood.  This unprecedented dataset incorporates genetic, demographic, and environmental data as well as a comprehensive range of measures assessing predictors and outcomes related to both mental and physical health of each participant with the aim of increasing our understanding of the many factors that can enhance or disrupt a young person's life trajectory</p>
